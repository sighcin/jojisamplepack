# The Joji Sample Pack Project.
It's 2018. And I think we're just about done.
There might not be any more action with this project, but we will be uploading the whole sample pack extremely soon.

Thanks for the wait.
We hope y'all will enjoy it.

### What is the Joji Sample Pack?
The Joji Sample Pack is a collection of sounds taken from Joji's music. Each selection of sounds are separated into different folders to make things more organized. This is a useful pack for anyone who wants to make a remix of a Joji song, as well as any fan-made content or anything similar.

### Why is this on GitHub?
I believe that using GitHub makes it much easier to track changes and updates to the project.
