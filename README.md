# Joji Sample Pack
This is a GitHub repo for the Joji Sample Pack project.

Special thanks to Reddit user [-JWS-](https://www.reddit.com/user/-JWS-) for providing a large number of the samples in the pack!!

## What is the Joji Sample Pack?
The Joji Sample Pack is a collection of sounds taken from Joji's music. Each selection of sounds are separated into different folders to make things more organized. This is a useful pack for anyone who wants to make a remix of a Joji song, as well as any fan-made content or anything similar.

### Why is this on GitHub?
I believe that using GitHub makes it much easier to track changes and updates to the project.

### Download Links

### Disclaimer
I am not intending any copyright infringement here. This is a fan-made pack of sounds extracted from Joji's music. However, if you are the copyright holder of any of the sounds in this repository, or if you do not want a sound to appear in this pack, please email me and we can resolve this. Thank you.
